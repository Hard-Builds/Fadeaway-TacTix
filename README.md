# Timeless TacTix

Timeless TacTix is a unique twist on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. In this game, only a maximum of four moves are allowed to stay alive on the playboard at any given time. As new moves are made, the oldest move vanishes from the board, providing players with an opportunity to strategize their next move.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns placing their markers (X or O) on the grid.
3. **Vanishing Moves**: After each move, the oldest move on the board turns grey, indicating that it will vanish if the maximum limit of four moves is reached.
4. **Winning**: The objective is still to get three of your markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.
5. **Draw**: Draw? There's no draw in this game, that's the fun part
